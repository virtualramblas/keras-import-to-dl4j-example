# keras-import-to-dl4j-example
A simple example of how to import a pre-trained [Keras](https://keras.io/) model into [DL4J](https://deeplearning4j.org/) and use it to make predictions in a JVM based environment.  

## The Keras model
The Keras model is a simple binary classifier. A [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook to train, validate and test it is provided. It has been derived from [this](https://github.com/bgweber/StartupDataScience/blob/master/DeepLearning/Keras_Binary_Classifier.ipynb) example.
In order to execute the notebook the following requirements have to be met:  
 - Python 3.6+
 - Keras 2.2.4 with TensorFlow backend
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib  
   
 After cloning this repo, just run Jupyter and then import the notebook and the *data* folder to use it.
